<div class="contain">
	<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Key Conditions for Use of Booking Engine (Bocar.SG) &ndash; In Plain English</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The booking you are about to make through Bocar.SG is a contract
			between you and the rental Agency. In no way is Bocar.SG a party to
			the previously mentioned contract.</li>
		<li>You must be legally eligible to make a booking through Bocar.SG.
			This means your driving license must be valid and you are eligible
			for insurance and you have the legal ability to enter a contract.</li>
		<li>By making a booking through Bocar.SG, you give Bocar.SG the
			arbitration right to assist in any decision making for any
			disagreement between you and the rental agency.</li>
		<li>We work hard with our rental partners to try our best to provide
			you with the car that you have selected during booking. However,
			please note that for one in five bookings, the car provided to you on
			the actual day of pick up may vary slightly (particularly colour and
			options). The car provided to you will be of similar grade or of
			higher grade.</li>
		<li>(Updated 5th Jan 2016) Cancellations are allowed but are only approved 
			on a case-by-case basis. Contact us at least 1 week before your actual 
			day of pickup to inform us of your cancellations. A small admin charge 
			may apply. Cancellation may not be allowed for some bookings and 
			those scenarios are listed in the full Terms &amp; Conditions. 
			See below for expected turnaround for refunds and reimbursements.</li>
		<li>We make every attempt to ensure the accuracy of the prices and
			promotions shown in Bocar.SG. Prices may be changed at any time and
			you may not be informed of the change nor will you be eligible for a
			refund in any scenario. The &lsquo;best deals&rsquo; described in
			Bocar.SG are based on certain assumptions. It is your responsibility
			to determine the suitability of such assumptions.</li>
		<li>In addition, please be aware that it is common trade practice for the rental partners 
			to add surcharges to their rental prices public holidays. Please allow the rental partner 
			to at least one month to update the holiday prices. For more details, 
			please read the full Terms &amp; Conditions.</li>
		<li>When you make a booking at Bocar.SG, you are guaranteed to have a vehicle during the actual day of pickup. 
			Failing which, Bocar.SG will compensate you up to 150% of the booking value. 
			For more details, please read the full Terms &amp; Conditions.</li>
		<li>Bocar.SG reserves the right to not honour bookings or rental rates that are in error. 
			In most cases, if the given rates vary by more than 20% from market rate, 
			the rate is understood to be unreasonable low and is likely to be in error.</li>
		<li>Partners may reject bookings if a valid reason is provided. In
			such cases, our partners will do a full refund the customer for the
			booking and NO admin charges may apply. Some of the valid reasons are
			listed below in the full Terms &amp; Conditions.</li>

		rental will be between you and the rental vehicle provider. The terms
		and conditions of the rental agreement between you and the rental

		the vehicle type and insert the other relevant information. Bocar.SG
		makes no warranty or representation in relation to any rental vehicle
		provider or any vehicle rented by any rental vehicle provider. It is
